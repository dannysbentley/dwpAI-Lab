    <h2>Software and Tools: Alien Species Conceptualization and Illustration</h2>
    <p>This captivating project engages participants in keen thought processes supported by AI (ChatGPT), coupled with skillful digital illustration (Midjourney). Together, these tools provide a holistic approach towards conceptualizing extraterrestrial life.</p>
    <p>Software and Tools:</p>

<div class="instructions">
    <h2>The Planet Forestia:</h2>
    <p>Size and Mass</p>
    <p>Forestia measures approximately 1.2 times the size of Earth with a radius of approximately 7,685 kilometers (all numbers referenced to Earth = 1). It has a higher mass due to a significantly denser core, nearing about 1.5 times Earth's mass.</p>

    <p>Orbit and Distance to the Sun</p>
    <p>Forestia orbits a G-type main-sequence star, similar to our sun, but slightly cooler and smaller. The radius of Forestia's orbit is approximately 1.3 Astronomical Units (AU, where 1 AU is the average Earth-Sun distance). This wide orbit radius and cooler sun results in an average distance to its sun comparable to that of Earth.</p>

    <p>Rotation and Revolution</p>
    <p>With a rotation period (day) slightly longer than Earth's at 26 hours, Forestia has a revolution period (year) of about 420 Earth days due to the increased orbit radius.</p>

    <p>Average Temperature and Climate</p>
    <p>Due to the presence of a dense, greenhouse gas-rich atmosphere, the planet maintains an overall average temperature of around 23 degrees Celsius. Heat is distributed relatively evenly due to extremely efficient oceanic and atmospheric heat transportation systems. These systems prevent extreme temperature variations, sustaining the extensive forest ecosystems.</p>

    <p>Humidity Level</p>
    <p>With constant rainfall and abundant bodies of water across the planet, Forestia has an average relative humidity of approximately 80-90%. This high level of humidity supports the growth of lush, biodiverse forests and contributes to a greenhouse effect, further stabilizing the planet's temperature.</p>

    <p>Soil Composition</p>
    <p>Forestia’s soil has a high organic matter content due to the constant decay and recycling of plant materials. Predominant soil minerals include silicates and aluminates from widespread volcanic activity, with substantial amounts of iron, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. These components, combined with the continuous rainfall, make the soil extremely fertile.</p>

    <p>Flora and Fauna</p>
    <P>The ubiquitous nature of water on Forestia has led to the development of flora with extensive root systems, capable of extracting oxygen in high-rainfall environments. Fungi also play crucial roles in the decomposition process, facilitating nutrient cycles and contributing to the soil's fertility.</P>

    <p>The planet boasts a high degree of biodiversity, with likely millions of species yet to be discovered. The animals are expected to have adapted to both aquatic and terrestrial life due to the planet's constant rain and humidity.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Forestia, in essence, is a verdant, water-abundant planet with steady rainfall and an impressively fertile, lush landscape — a dream locale for any exoplanet biologist. It's a tantalizing subject for further study, holding an enormous potential to house a rich ecosystem teeming with unknown species.</p>
